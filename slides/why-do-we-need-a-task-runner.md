##  Why do we need a task runner?

<img src="images/why.gif">

### Because automation <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
### Because I'm lazy <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
### Because I'm not perfect <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


note:
- Because automation! It's all about saving time and making your life easier. 
- I'm not perfect, I can't know everything, and task automation can fill in those gaps. 
- I tend to get lazy with the things I "should" do when developing and shipping. I can set it up once and ship amazing code.
